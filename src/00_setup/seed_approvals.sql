-- Seed the demo approval state so the Ingestion tab tells a story:
-- two of the three vendor feeds are already approved and merged; only the
-- Geospatial Hazard update is awaiting actuary review. This matches the
-- demo narrative: "the actuary just got a Slack notification that a new
-- geo hazard version has landed".
--
-- Re-run safe: clears any prior approvals on these datasets, then writes
-- a fresh "approved" row for market_pricing_benchmark and credit_bureau_summary.
-- Leaves geospatial_hazard_enrichment alone so it stays in "pending review".

-- Make sure the approvals table exists (the FastAPI handler usually creates
-- it lazily; doing it here so the seed can run even before the app starts).
