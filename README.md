# P&C Insurance Pricing — Databricks Accelerator

End-to-end pricing data transformation for commercial property & casualty
insurance, from raw vendor data to live pricing decisions with full governance.

## What this is

A reusable demo/accelerator showing the complete pricing lifecycle on Databricks:

- **Medallion architecture:** External data → Bronze → Silver (DLT) → Gold (UPT)
- **6 pricing models:** GLM frequency/severity, GBM demand/uplift/fraud/retention
- **Derived factors:** urban_score, neighbourhood claim frequency — with per-factor lift attribution
- **Quote stream:** live commercial quote traffic captured as three JSON payloads per transaction; lookup, outlier detection, and replay in one place
- **HITL app:** React + FastAPI for actuarial review and approval
- **Real-time serving:** Online Feature Store + Model Serving with auto feature lookup
- **Full governance:** Audit trail, regulatory PDF export, UC lineage
- **Optional AI agents:** LLM-assisted model selection, DQ monitor, explainability (off by default)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/wryszka/pricing-bbt-demo.git
cd pricing-bbt-demo

# 2. Configure (edit databricks.yml with your workspace)
#    Change catalog_name and workspace host

# 3. Deploy
databricks bundle deploy

# 4. Run setup (creates tables + test data)
databricks bundle run setup_demo

# 5. Run pipeline
databricks bundle run ingest_external_data
databricks bundle run build_upt
databricks bundle run train_pricing_models

# 6. Open the app (URL in Databricks Serving UI)
```

## Architecture

```
External Data → Volume → Bronze → DLT (expectations) → Silver
                                                          ↓
Internal Data (policies, claims, quotes) ───────→ Unified Pricing Table (Gold)
                                                          ↓
              Feature Lookup → Train 6 Models → MLflow → UC Registry
                                                          ↓
              Online Store (Lakebase) → Model Serving → REST API
                                                          ↓
              GOVERNANCE: UC Lineage │ Audit Log │ Time Travel │ DQ Monitoring
```
