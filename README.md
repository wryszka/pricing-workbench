# Pricing Workbench — Databricks Accelerator

End-to-end commercial P&C pricing on Databricks, from raw vendor data to live
pricing decisions with full governance and investigation.

## What this is

A reusable accelerator showing the complete pricing lifecycle on Databricks:

- **Medallion architecture:** External data → Bronze → Silver (DLT) → Gold (UPT)
- **6 pricing models:** GLM frequency/severity, GBM demand/uplift/fraud/retention
- **Real UK public data enrichment:** ~1.5M English postcodes from ONSPD + IMD 2019 + ONS RUC + coastal flags — feeds `urban_score`, `deprivation_composite`, `is_coastal` and the challenger lift story
- **Quote Review:** investigation workflow for "why was I charged so much?" — looks up any transaction, shows the three JSON payloads captured from the sales channel and rating engine, replays against today's model, and includes an AI-analyst placeholder for Claude-powered root-cause analysis
- **New Data Impact study** (`src/new_data_impact/`): standalone 6-notebook track for data scientists/actuaries — demonstrates that real external data materially improves pricing models (Gini 0.11 → 0.25 on a 200K home-insurance portfolio)
- **HITL app:** React + FastAPI for actuarial review and approval
- **Real-time serving:** Online Feature Store + Model Serving with auto feature lookup
- **Full governance:** Audit trail, regulatory PDF export, UC lineage
- **Optional AI agents:** LLM-assisted model selection, DQ monitor, explainability (off by default)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/wryszka/pricing-workbench.git
cd pricing-workbench

# 2. Configure (edit databricks.yml with your workspace)
#    Change catalog_name and workspace host

# 3. Deploy
databricks bundle deploy

# 4. Run setup (creates tables + test data)
databricks bundle run setup_demo

# 5. Build the real UK postcode enrichment (~2-5 min — ONSPD + IMD download)
databricks bundle run build_postcode_enrichment

# 6. Run pipeline
databricks bundle run ingest_external_data
databricks bundle run build_upt
databricks bundle run train_pricing_models

# 7. Sync the notebook track to your Workspace Home folder
./scripts/sync_notebooks.sh
#   → /Workspace/Users/<you>/pricing-workbench/new_data_impact/

# 8. Open the app (URL in Databricks Serving UI)
```

## Two tracks

| Track | For | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| **Pricing Workbench app** | Execs, underwriters, operators, actuaries | React app — sidebar: Data Ingestion, Model Factory, Quote Review, Governance, etc. |
| **New Data Impact study** (`src/new_data_impact/`) | Data scientists, actuaries, governance | 6 notebooks — build enrichment → train standard vs enriched models → governance PDF → AI agent |

Both tracks share the same Unity Catalog schema (`pricing_upt`). The study's derivative tables are prefixed `impact_*` so they group together in Catalog Explorer; the reusable `postcode_enrichment` reference is used by both tracks.

## Architecture

```
External Data → Volume → Bronze → DLT (expectations) → Silver
                                                          ↓
Internal Data (policies, claims, quotes) ───────→ Unified Pricing Table (Gold)
                                                          ↓
              Feature Lookup → Train 6 Models → MLflow → UC Registry
                                                          ↓
              Online Store (Lakebase) → Model Serving → REST API
                                                          ↓
              GOVERNANCE: UC Lineage │ Audit Log │ Time Travel │ DQ Monitoring
```
